The function you provided, is_prime(n), is designed to determine whether a given integer n is a prime number or not. Here's an explanation of how the function works:

if n <= 1::
This is the first check in the function. It tests whether the input integer n is less than or equal to 1. In mathematics, prime numbers are defined as positive integers greater than 1. If n is less than or equal to 1, it cannot be a prime number, so the function returns False immediately.

for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)::
This is a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (rounded up to the nearest integer). It checks potential divisors of n. Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves, so if any integer i within this range evenly divides n (i.e., n % i == 0), then n is not a prime number.

if n % i == 0::
Within the loop, this condition checks if the current value of i evenly divides n. If it does, it means that n has a divisor other than 1 and itself, so it's not a prime number. The function returns False in this case.

Finally, if the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function reaches return True, indicating that n is a prime number, as it wasn't evenly divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of n.
